Generating semantically and temporally aligned audio content in accordance with video input has become a focal point for researchers, particularly following the remarkable breakthrough in text-to-video generation. We aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm.

## Install
First install the python requirements. We recommend using conda:

```
conda create -n vta-ldm python=3.10
conda activate vta-ldm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then download the checkpoints from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/ariesssxu/vta-ldm-clip4clip-v-large), we recommend using git lfs:
```
mkdir ckpt && cd ckpt
git clone https://huggingface.co/ariesssxu/vta-ldm-clip4clip-v-large
# pull if large files are skipped:
cd vta-ldm-clip4clip-v-large && git lfs pull
```

## Model List
- ✅ VTA_LDM (the base model)  
- 🕳️ VTA_LDM+IB/LB/CAVP/VIVIT  
- 🕳️ VTA_LDM+text  
- 🕳️ VTA_LDM+PE
- 🕳️ VTA_LDM+text+concat  
- 🕳️ VTA_LDM+pretrain+text+concat  

## Inference
Put the video pieces into the `data` directory. Run the provided inference script to generate audio content from the input videos:
```
bash inference_from_video.sh
```
You can custom the hyperparameters to fit your personal requirements. We also provide a script that can help merge the generated audio content with the original video based on ffmpeg:

```
bash tools/merge_video_audio
```
## Training 
TBD. Code Coming Soon.
