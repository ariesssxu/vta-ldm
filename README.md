Generating semantically and temporally aligned audio content in accordance with video input has become a focal point for researchers, particularly following the remarkable breakthrough in text-to-video generation. We aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm.

## Install
First install the python requirements. We recommend using conda:

```
conda create -n vta-ldm python=3.10
conda activate vta-ldm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then download the checkpoints from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/ariesssxu/vta-ldm-clip4clip-v-large), we recommend using git lfs:
```
mkdir ckpt && cd ckpt
git clone https://huggingface.co/ariesssxu/vta-ldm-clip4clip-v-large
# pull if large files are skipped:
cd vta-ldm-clip4clip-v-large && git lfs pull
```

## Model List
- ‚úÖ VTA_LDM (the base model)  
- üï≥Ô∏è VTA_LDM+IB/LB/CAVP/VIVIT  
- üï≥Ô∏è VTA_LDM+text  
- üï≥Ô∏è VTA_LDM+PE
- üï≥Ô∏è VTA_LDM+text+concat  
- üï≥Ô∏è VTA_LDM+pretrain+text+concat  

## Inference
Put the video pieces into the `data` directory. Run the provided inference script to generate audio content from the input videos:
```
bash inference_from_video.sh
```
You can custom the hyperparameters to fit your personal requirements. We also provide a script that can help merge the generated audio content with the original video based on ffmpeg:

```
bash tools/merge_video_audio.sh
```
## Training 
Our training code is built on the accelerate framework for efficient, distributed training. We provide a simple training example in `train.py` and a basic starting script in `train.sh`. The training script includes our experimental trials with different audio encoders and supports multiple modalities.

For data preparation, please refer to line 268 in `train.py`, which demonstrates how we load and process the dataset. Briefly, the dataloader expects your data configuration to be split into three separate files: `train/valid/test.jsonl`. Each of these files should list your data samples (one per line) in the following format:
```
# train.jsonl
{"video_path": xxx, "feature_file": xxx, "audio_file": xxx, "description": xxx}
{"video_path": xxx, "feature_file": xxx, "audio_file": xxx, "description": xxx}
{"video_path": xxx, "feature_file": xxx, "audio_file": xxx, "description": xxx}
...
``` 
For video-to-audio experiments, only "video_path" and "audio_file" are mandatory. A reference preprocessing routine is available in tools/data_tools.py (line 70).

And then just run:
```
bash train.sh
```
Extracting key frames from videos during training can be a significant bottleneck, primarily due to I/O limitations when reading video files on the server we used. In our workflow, we extract key frames in advance to speed up training. Please refer to `tools/data_tools.py` (line 23) for more details.

The training should be finished in 3 days using 8 nvidia a100 cards.
